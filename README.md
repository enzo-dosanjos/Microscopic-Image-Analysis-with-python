# Microscopic-Image-Analysis-with-python
Determine the size of grains on microscopic image of metal's structure

This is a school project where the goal is to make our own library to analyse a microscopic picture of a metal's structure, 
and get different informations on the grains, like their size, shape and number

------------------------------------------------ Dependencies ------------------------------------------------

-Python 3.9 or later with :

  - numpy  
  - opencv-python  
  - termcolor  
  - matplotlib  

(use pip install/conda install along with the name of each of the package in any console to install the required package)


-------------------------------------------- Running the program --------------------------------------------

You first need to provide an image in the Images folder. Name it something simple, or name it "Metal_Structure.png" as this is the default name. 

Once you have all the dependencies, simply lauch "ImageAnalysisMain.py" from the console or in an IDE, and simply type your inputs in the console.

When finished, the file will be save in the Data folder, along with a datalog of all the informations of the cells. Also, the image will be displayed.
To close the images, enter anything inside the console.
